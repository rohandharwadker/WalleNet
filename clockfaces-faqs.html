        <div class="faq-question">
          <h2>How do I change my clock face to 24/12 hour time?</h2>
          <p>Changing your watch to 24/12 hour time actually has nothing to do with the clock face.
              Go to <i>fitbit.com</i>. Click on the gear icon. Go to Settings > Personal Info > Advanced
              Settings > Clock Display Time and switch to the desired units.

        <div class="faq-question">
          <h2>Why is my Fitbit showing the wrong time?</h2>
          <p>
            This problem has nothing to do with the clock face. If your Fitbit device is displaying the wrong time, make sure you are syncing the watch with your phone via the Fitbit mobile app. You
            may also want to try restarting your phone and/or your Fitbit device.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-question">
          <h2>Why is my clock face taking so long to install?</h2>
          <p>
            This is a very common issue and has nothing to do with the actual clock face. Try restarting the app. If you have an Android device, 'Force Stop' the app and then try again. You can
            also try restarting your phone and your Fitbit device. If the problem persists, contact Fitbit
            support by calling <i>(877) 623 4997</i>.
